Thank you for purchasing the node guide from https://multisniperbot.com
This guide was designed to work on :
Clean server with UBUNTU 20.04
Recomended Hetzner
https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/px93/configurator
Location: Germany
Scroll down and chose 1 x 3.84 TB NVMe SSD Datacenter Edition

Follow these steps to configure your server:

1. connect with putty
2. run this command:

installimage

3. chose Ubuntu from the list + enter
4. chose Ubuntu-2110-impish-amd64-base + enter
5. press enter on the OK page
6. use the down arrow and go to the line:

# RAID 0: ~3576 
and just remove the # in front of that line

7. go down to the line:

PART /home ext4 all 
and just put # in front of that line

8. go to the line :

PART / ext4 2014G
and modify it like this
PART / ext4 3500G

9. press F2 to save and enter
10. press F10 and enter to continue
11. wait for the ubuntu setup to be done and reboot the server with the command:

reboot

Congratulation you installed ubuntu on your server!
Now connect with putty again to the server and run these commands:

cd /
wget https://multi-sniper.com/scripts/start.sh
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh

It's an universal script so even if you see MultiSniper Plus install/update, that will only work if you purchased on the website and you dm @x3raphim on telegram with your server ip so your server can be whitelisted.

In terminal type these commands to check your node:
# For BSC
systemctl status bsc-node.service
cd /
/home/bscfullnode/bsc/build/bin/geth attach http://127.0.0.1:8547 --exec 'eth.syncing'
